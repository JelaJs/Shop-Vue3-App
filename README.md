# Shop-Vue3-App

# Short description

The app has different components like a home component, a component for each category, a component for a single product, etc...
It is also important that the application is fully responsive, so users will be able to access it both from computers and mobile devices

When the user opens the application, he will land on the home page.
When the user scrolls through the home page, he can see different sections like categories and products from different categories, products slider, etc...

Users can decide in which product category he is interested and they can explore different products for that category.
After the user decides on which product he is interested in, he can explore a single item to see the description and price. There he can add an item to the cart, or he can choose how many products he wants, and buy the product immediately.
If he decides to add items to the cart, the user will have the mobility to add multiple products, and after he chooses everything he wants to buy, he will have the total price calculated and checkout button there.

While developing I used API calls to get products from "https://fakestoreapi.com/".
The design is simple and very easy for users to navigate. There are no unnecessary animations, only minimal transitions to make the app pleasant for the user.
