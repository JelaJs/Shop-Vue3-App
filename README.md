# Shop-Vue3-App

# Short description

The app has different components like a home component, a component for each category, a component for a single product, etc...
It is also important that the application is fully responsive, so users will be able to access it both from computers and mobile devices

When the user opens the application, he will land on the home page.
When the user scrolls through the home page, he can see different sections like categories and products from different categories, products slider, etc...

Users can choose the product category they're interested in and explore various items within that category. Once a user finds a product they like,they can view its description and price. From there, they have the option to add the item to their cart or purchase it immediately, specifying the quantity if they wish. If they opt to add items to their cart, they can continue browsing and adding multiple products. When ready, they can view the total price of their selections and proceed to checkout. This app provides users with the flexibility to shop at their own pace and easily manage their purchases.

While developing I used API calls to get products from "https://fakestoreapi.com/".
The design is simple and very easy for users to navigate. There are no unnecessary animations, only minimal transitions to make the app pleasant for the user.
